As we review the GSoC proposals, some common feedback we have for the contributors are listed below.

**Documentation and testing should be continuous tasks and not limited to one week at the end of the project timeline.**

It is fine to have one wrap-up week at the end to polish the testing and documentation. But you should not limit your documentation and testing entirely to one week. These should go on throughout the GSoC period.

**Utilize the whole timeframe of the GSoC.**

Midterm evaluation is like a midpoint. There is a work period following the midterm evaluation. In general, up to half of the coding effort happens during this period.

While we appreciate the expectation to finish the project early, it may also imply you are not aiming to work for the whole duration of the GSoC (35 or 17.5 hours/week * 10 weeks) or are largely underestimating the effort needed for the project.
