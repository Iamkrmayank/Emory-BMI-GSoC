# Communicating with the mentors

**We are using Slack as the primary medium of communication. Find and join the Emory BMI slack workspace using the link - http://bit.ly/emory-bmi.**

Emory BMI has a strong commitment to open-source, as both users and developers. Our Slack has more than 1,000 enthusiastic contributors, making us an enthusiastic open-source community.

Each idea on this page has at least one mentor assigned. Each project idea also has a relevant channel in the Slack workspace, listed below under each project idea. Make sure to join the rooms that are relevant for the projects that you are interested in. Specific discussions on each project idea happens in those channels.

Please feel free to introduce yourself in the relevant Slack channel. But please do not send individual messages to the mentors in DMs as that does not support the community environment we strive to make with the GSoC and open source in general.

## Large projects (full-time) vs. Medium-size (half-time) projects

This year, contributors are given the option to contribute to a project full-time (35 hours a week and 350 hours in total, a large project) or half-time (about 18 hours a week and 175 hours in total, a medium-size project). We have indicated how we see a project's size/scope is, as Full-time, Half-time, and Full-time/Half-time. Whenever we have indicated Full-time/Half-time, it illustrates that the project has some flexibility to change the scope and complexity as the contributor sees fit. In any case, these are given as suggestions and contributors have the freedom to propose their own estimate of full-time or half-time in their project proposal.
