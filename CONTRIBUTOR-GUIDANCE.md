# Communicating with the mentors

**We are asking the contributors to communicate via the discussion forums of each project's GitHub repository or this [discussion forum](https://github.com/NISYSLAB/Emory-BMI-GSoC/discussions).**

Each idea on this page has at least one mentor assigned. Each existing project also has a relevant discussion forum in their GitHub source repository, listed below under each project idea. Specific discussions on each project idea happen in those discussion forums.

Please feel free to introduce yourself (include your email) in the [discussion forum](https://github.com/NISYSLAB/Emory-BMI-GSoC/discussions). But please avoid individual messages to the mentors as that does not support the community environment we strive to make with the GSoC and open source in general.

Break the timeline into periods of up to 7 days

**8.1) Community Bonding Period**

**8.2) Development Phase**

**8.3) Project Completion, testing, and documentation**

**9) Planned GSoC work hours**

This year, the full-time projects are expected a 35 hours a week contribution (large project) and half-time projects are expected a 18 hours a week contribution (medium size project). Please indicate your choice of the project length. All project ideas have an indication how we see a project to be (full-time, half-time, or a potential/flexibility to be either based on the contributor's proposal).

Please also indicate the work hours (including the timezone), that you hope to work on your project. 

**10) Planned absence/vacation days and other commitments during the GSoC period (including the community bonding period)**

Please indicate if you have any lectures/classes, examinations, or other personal commitments. GSoC 2022 also allows flexibility of an additional two months - to complete the project at a later time frame (a shift of up to 2 additional months). Please indicate if you expect to do that as we can plan accordingly.

**11) Skill Set**

Your relevant skill set to complete this project. Include pointers to bug fixes, demos, and previous work.

Also include pointers to the completed Code Challenge (if applicable).
