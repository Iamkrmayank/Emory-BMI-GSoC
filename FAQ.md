* How can I contact the mentor?

This question is often asked in the GitHub discussion forums here. Since you are already getting the replies here, the answer is, you can contact the mentors in the GitHub discussion forums, as listed under each project idea.

* Why I did not get a reply from the mentors?

While we try to reply to all the questions, sometimes we ignore certain generic questions. "I like project idea #1. Can you please let me know how to get started?" is a question that can be written by anyone without even a bit of effort on their part. To ensure you get replies, make sure to ask specific questions. Also, go through the previous discussions and documentation first to make sure your question is already answered somewhere else.

Also, please do not contact the mentors via emails and social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, ...) messages. We are unlikely to accept LinkedIn/Facebook friend requests and messages from potential contributors. While we appreciate the enthusiams, we cannot handle messages coming from all the various means/media. Therefore, please stick to the proposed communication channels.

* I have my proposal draft ready. How can I get the opinions of the mentors?

This is the exception where we ask you to send the project proposal drafts to the mentors. The mentors' email addresses are listed under each project idea.

* I shared my project proposal draft with the mentor. But I did not hear back from them.

We try our best to leave comments or at least acknowledge the emails with project proposals. But we do not find a need to comment, "Looks good" or "Looks ok" on proposals. Unless we have specific comments, we do not comment on your proposal.

* I received comment from mentor-1 on my proposal. But I did not receive comments from mentor-2, mentor-3, and mentor-4.

While we appreciate your enthusiasm to perfect your proposal, please also understand that the GSoC application period is a big time commitment. So, it is very unlikely you will receive comments from multiple mentors at once. But we all will eventually review the proposals (and get back to you with comments if we need to clarify anything regarding your proposal - even after the application deadline).

* I submitted a pull request. Why wasn't it merged?

We test and merge pull requests eventually. GSoC induces a large number of pull requests at once. So, it may take some time to test and merge those. Also, not all the pull requests will be merged. Even if your pull request fixes the reported issue, if it does not follow the coding best practices or introduces additional bugs, we will have to close the pull request with a comment. Please take that as a positive learning experience. Whether your pull request is merged or not, you can (and should) definitely include the links to the pull requests in your proposal.

* I have reported a bug in your project. Can I submit a pull request to the bug I reported?

If the reported bug is easy to fix, you can attempt that. Otherwise, please wait for a mentor to confirm the bug. Because some of those bugs you report may be an intended feature. So you do not want to spend your time working on a fix which will eventually be closed without merging.

* Please assign bug-X to me.

If this is an open bug that was open for a long time, feel free to attempt a fix at it. While this may mean there will be some duplicate effort during the application period (since multiple candidates may be attempting to fix the bug), it will help you highlight your effort in the GSoC proposal. No need to wait for someone to assign an existing bug to you. (The only exception is when the bug report was created by you. In that case, as mentioned above, please wait for a mentor to confirm the bug - unless the bug is a trivial one to fix.)

* I have an interesting project idea that is not listed in the ideas list. Can I submit a proposal to this idea?

Yes, go ahead. But please note that one of our mentors should find your proposa interesting enough to accept your own project idea. Historically, that has never happened. (The own project ideas have always tend to be spammy.)
